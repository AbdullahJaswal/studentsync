# StudentSync

***Submission for RMIT Hackathon (by SWITCH x CSIT)***

### What it does

StudentSync allows RMIT students to seamlessly find and form effective teams for group assignments. Students can:
- Create an account and add their RMIT Canvas academic calendar to automatically sync upcoming assignments.
- View assignments and seek out team members who are available at the same times and share similar academic goals.

### How we built it

StudentSync was developed using a React/Next.js frontend for a dynamic and responsive user interface. This allows for seamless navigation and real-time updates for users. On the backend, we used Django, a powerful Python-based web framework, to handle authentication, user data, and backend logic. All data are securely stored and managed with PostgreSQL, a robust and scalable database. By leveraging modern frameworks like React, Next.js, Django, and PostgreSQL, we were able to create a scalable, user-friendly app that is fast, secure, and reliable.
